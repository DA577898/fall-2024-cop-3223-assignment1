Compilation instructions

Using gcc:

gcc fracturing.c -o fracturing.exe

I have included a .sh script, which I programmed to simplify this process.
Alternatively, you can find the output in actions, following the autograder given by the course administrators.

If there's any problems compiling this, please submit an issue report through GitHub.
